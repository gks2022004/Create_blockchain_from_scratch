# Create_blockchain_from_scratch

In this repositry I have made a simple blockchain using python 

After running this file using Flask, you need to do these steps:
We can the URL in our terminal, in my case I get this  http://127.0.0.1:5000, then we can proceed to next step

# For mining the block:

 After opening this url http://127.0.0.1:5000 ,add the function we have used for mining the block
 ```mine_block``` and add this in url like this:  http://127.0.0.1:5000/mine_block.
 This will mine the block, and reload the website for mining another block, you can do as much as you want.
 
 # For getting the Blockchain:
 
 Add ```get_chain``` ,  in this url http://127.0.0.1:5000 as told in above step
 
 # My Blockchain:
